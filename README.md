## About
A stochastic method to generate an approximation to the Sierpinski triangle.

## Demo

## Algorithm
1. Pick a random point p inside the triangle ([algorithm](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2020/10/19/random-points-in-triangle.html)).
2. Draw it.
3. Pick a random vertex of the triangle and find its midpoint with p. Set p to that midpoint.
4. Go to step 2.

## Why it works
Not sure. Need to figure this one out.
